## Abstract ##

This document describes the bytecode specifications
of the runtimeOS script language.


## Document Syntax ##

Per declaration:
   First line for field names: header payload
   Second line for byte count: [4]    [VLB]

Each declaration serves as a section that can later be referenced.

Byte counts, or exact byte 
sequences can be defined as follows:

[txt x]: A block of data with the exact byte sequence written at x
[n]:     A block of data where n is the byte count
[VLB]:   A variable block of data, where the byte count is defined by the value saved in the block beforehand
[flag]:  A block of data with the size of a single byte
[S x]:   A section will be inserted here, where x is the section
[VCS x]: A section will be repeated here as often as declared in the previous block, where the section to insert is x
