### Abstract ###

This document defines the instruction-set to be implemented
by the virtual machine.


### The Stack ###

The stack entry size is defined by the <n> prefix, where n is the bit count. 
For all operations, the result will be override the 0th stack position.
For all operations, the 

Stack [
  3 [ ] [ ]...              <- ("$top" pointer type)
  2 [ ] [ ]...
  1 <4>[pointer type]  <4>[primitive type]  <?>[]  <64>[value/pointer]

  0 [(4bit) result]           <- (all results, regardless of type, will be moved here)
]


### Semantics ###
